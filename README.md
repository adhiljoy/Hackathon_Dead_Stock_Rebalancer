# Dead Stock Rebalancer

## Problem
Fashion retailers face revenue loss due to dead stock in some stores while the same products stock out in others. Existing systems detect this too late and rely on manual redistribution.

## Solution
A React-based decision dashboard that:
- Identifies dead stock early at the store level
- Highlights demand stores for the same SKU
- Recommends safe store-to-store inventory transfers

## Tech Stack
- React (frontend)
- JavaScript (business logic)
- JSON datasets (simulated retail data)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start the app:
   npm start

## Intended Users
Inventory planners and merchandising teams in fashion retail.
